# Heart Attack Prediction
> This is the deep learning model to predict the ***chance of a person having heart attack***.

# Descriptions
>Clinicians believe that prevention of heart attack is always better than curing 
it. After many years of research, scientists and clinicians discovered that, the 
probability of oneâ€™s getting heart attack can be determined by analysing the
patientâ€™s age, gender, exercise induced angina, number of major vessels, chest 
pain indication, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, 
resting electrocardiographic results, and maximum heart rate achieved.

>Thus, this app will predict the ***chance of a person having heart attack*** by analysing below features: 
- Age
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Chest pain type
- Exercise induced angina
- Number of major vessels colored by flourosopy
- Thallium stress test
